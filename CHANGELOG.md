## üìó  unFold 5.0<br><br>
### This release includes all features of **unFold 4.0** and comes with A LOT of fresh goods just for you!

1. Thanks to the introduction of **‚ÄûreFold‚Äù** framework prepared by [Shades84](https://github.com/Shades84).  
Today we have **16 new button variants** for 4 popular apps courtesy of [Veexer](https://github.com/veexer):

    - Valorant
    - Vivaldi browser
    - VS Code
    - Adobe Premiere Pro
#### **Each of those apps received following 4 button variants:**
    - Black, animated to the left
    - Black, animated to the right
    - White, animated to the left
    - White, animated to the right

#### some new icons were added to @Resources\reFold
- (I'll create buttons for those apps in the future if someone doesn't Usain Bolt me!)<br><br>

2. **Docs 2.0** - the project Readme.md was thoroughly reworked by contribution of [Veexer](https://github.com/veexer).  
Following adjustments were made:

    - **ALL** sections of _readme.md_ were reworked
      - Any **grammatical errors and typos** that were found, were fixed  
      - Entire documentation received **custom styling**
      - Almost **entire documentation** was rewritten, rephreased or otherwise adjusted
      - **Links were adjusted to be local** (accessed within repository) wherever that was possible
      - Some **sections were renamed** and "Table of contents" was adjusted accordingly.
      - Some **files were renamed** to ensure they use professional naming schemes
      - Guidelines for installation and use were adjusted to utilize the **‚ÄûreFold‚Äù** framework
      - Link to the folder folder which contains fresh **Vivaldi browser buttons was added as suggested point of reference in case of issues when creating buttons with **‚ÄûreFold‚Äù****
      - The readme.md Link routing to **"REALESES_FEATURES.md" due to a typo (404) was fixed**
      - **"RELEASES_FEATURES.md" was renamed to "CHANGELOG.MD"**
      - **"CHANGELOG.MD" was reformatted and overall improved**

      ### The introduction of **‚ÄûreFold‚Äù** made creation of new buttons significantly easier 
      #### Once again, Kudos to [Shades84](https://github.com/Shades84)!

      I hope that improvements in terms of documentation  
       and introduction of additional "ready and working" references on how to use the framework  
       will result in steady increase in number of project assets (new buttons!).  
  ### I believe the most efficient way to create buttons for now is to clone the new Vivaldi files (adjust .exe path + .png filename and voila!)  <br><br>
             That's about it, there's a lot of changes so if I forgot to mention anything
             - I hope it'll be a nice surprise!
