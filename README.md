## What are the unFold skins? :computer:
The **unFold** skins are buttons that can be added on your desktop to use them as shortcuts.<br />
They have very nice designs and you can add them in the right/left of your desktop.
###### You can have something like this:
![Example of Desktop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30848819/50526747-ca391480-0aa9-11e9-832c-b93dbca7e8d7.jpg)
###### Where the unFold buttons are:

## Pre-requirements :memo:
Things you need to use **all** this skins on your desktop.
* Have the last version of Rainmeter (this project was developed in version 4.2.0) installed in your PC.
* Enough space on your disk to clone or download the skins.
* Know the path where the skins of Rainmeter are located.

If you just want to add **some** of this buttons you need:
* Have the others unFold buttons (if you don't have them, you can download the DevilRev one's [here](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449) or download a realease from [here](https://github.com/Ruben35/Icons-unFold-Rainmeter/releases)).
## Installation :wrench:
Now, you can only go to the [releases](https://github.com/Ruben35/Icons-unFold-Rainmeter/releases) apart and **download** the latest binary **_.rmskin_**, then you only need to **execute** the binary and add the skin (if you have already the unFold skin this will upgrade them adding the new buttons)

But if you want, you can do it the old way :hammer_and_pick:. 

The steps you need to follow in order to install any button of here are:
1. **Clone** or **download** this project.
2. **Select** the folder of the button you want to add on your desktop.
3. **Paste** the folder in the Skins of Rainmeter in the folder "unFold" (if you still don't have the others unFold buttons you can download them [here](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449)).
4. **Enter** into "_Buttons_" and **select** the button you want or **copy** & **paste** all the folder into "@Resources/Buttons" (if you do the last you can ommit step 5).
5. Depending on the type of button (Black, Transparent or White), you need to **copy** the image and **paste** it into the folder "@Resources/Buttons".
6. Now, just **open** Rainmeter, **search** unFold and **load** the button you want. You can change the position of it but this kind of buttons are always in the border right or left of the dektop.
7. If the path of a button doesn't work, probably you should **edit** the file (in each file it has on the top a comment that indicate where you need to change the path) and **write** the correct path of your program.

# reFold ðŸ“°
_reFold is a modified version of unFold where everything (except the icon) can be defined in the "ini" file._ Allows you to have different color text, background etc with minimal adjustments.

## reFold Configuration 
* Download the repository and make copies of the reFold-template_Left or reFold-template_Right 
* rename the folder for your app
* open the "ini" file and go to the ```[Variables]``` section
* configure your shortcut:
    - **Width, Height, maxWidth**: set the collapsed and expanded size of the button
    - **bgColor**: sets the background color and oppacity. Oppacity should be at least 1
    - **iconColor**: sets the icon color
    - **iconPath**: path to the icon. Place icons in the "Images" folder in the unFold skin 
    - **iconSize**: sets icon size
    - **textColor**: sets color of text
    - **textString**: text to be displayed on the button
    - **textFont**: font face. Windows installed fonts and fonts in "Fonts" folder are valid
    - **textWeight**: sets text weight. 100 = thin, 900 = bold
    - **textSize**: sets text size
    - **application**: Change this for your application. See bellow for more syntax
### application syntax
The simplest usage of the application is to simple put the full path to your application in square brackets and double quotes. Eg:\
```application = ["C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"]```\
```application = ["C:\Users\Username\Documents\important.doc"]```

or if your application is already in your ```PATH``` environment variable, you can simply call:\
```application = ["chrome.exe"]```

If you'd like to open a program with paramaters that is done as such:\
```application = !Execute ["chrome.exe" rainmeter.net]```\
```application = !Execute ["chrome.exe" --incognito rainmeter.net]```

You can launch multiple programs at once by putting multiple actions there\
```application= !Execute ["chrome.exe" rainmeter.net]["Calc.exe"]```

In short, any action you can do with rainmeter is valid here.
