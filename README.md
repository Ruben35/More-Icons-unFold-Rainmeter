## 1. What are the unFold skins?
The **unFold** skins are buttons that You can add to your desktop and use them as way better looking shortcuts.
They have a gorgeous design and **unFold** themselves when You hover over them!

###### Example of desktop design making use of unFold buttons:

## 2. Pre-requirements
Before you can use **unFold** buttons to make Your desktop all shiny, You'll need 2 very simple things:
* [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net) (version 4.2.0 or higher) installed on your PC. 
* A tiny little bit of free space on your drive (perhaps 10MB)

If you'd like to see some more examples of **unFold** buttons,
I very much recommend taking a look at this [DeviantArt gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev/art/unFold-A-Launcher-618503449) made by [DevilRev](https://www.deviantart.com/devilrev),
who has originally initiated the idea of **unFold** buttons.

**The simplest way:**

1. Head to the [releases](https://github.com/Ruben35/Icons-unFold-Rainmeter/releases) page and **download** the latest **_.rmskin_** binary

**The oldschool way:**
1. Download this repository by clicking the **green "code" button** and selecting **"download zip"**.
- Alternatively you can clone the repository using 'git clone' directly via terminal

## reFold ðŸ“°
_reFold is a modified version of unFold where everything (except the icon) can be defined in the "ini" file._
This allows you to have different color text, background, etc., with code adjustments alone,
making creation of new buttons way easier!

### reFold Configuration 
To use reFold, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository and make copies of the `reFold-template_Left` or `reFold-template_Right`.
2. Download a square .png of the app logo you're looking to create a button for, to your drive(you can find this kind of .png on the web).
3. Place the .png file in the **@Resources\reFold** path inside of **Rainmeter/Skins**
4. In the main directory create a folder and name it exactly the same as the app you'd like to create a button for.
For example If you'd like to create a button for **Roblox**, name the folder **Roblox**.
In this folder depending on the style of button or buttons you're going to make, create subfolder(s):
- "Black" (for buttons with black background and white text and logo)
- "White" (for buttons with white background and black text and logo)
- "Transparent" (for buttons with no background)
5. Paste the template **"ini"** file into one of the folders
3. Open the "ini" file with a text editor and scroll to the [Variables] section.
4. Configure the file:

- `Width`, `Height`, `maxWidth`: Define the collapsed and expanded size of the button.
- `bgColor`: Defines the background color and opacity. Opacity should be at least 1.
- `iconColor`: Defines the icon color.
- `iconPath`: Defines path to the icon. Place icons in the "Images" folder in the unFold skin.
- `iconSize`: Defines icon size.
- `textColor`: Defines color of text.
- `textString`: Defines text to be displayed on the button.
- `textFont`: Defines font face. Windows installed fonts and fonts in "Fonts" folder are valid.
- `textWeight`: Defines text weight. 100 = thin, 900 = bold.
- `textSize`: Defines text size.
- `application`: Change this to match the path to the application the button should run. Please see below for more information about syntax.

### application syntax
The simplest way to set the application parameter correctly is to put the full path to your application in square brackets and double quotes. Eg:\
```application = ["C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"]```\
```application = ["C:\Users\Username\Documents\important.doc"]```

or if your application is already available via your ```PATH``` environment variable, you can just call:\
```application = ["chrome.exe"]```

If you'd like to open a program with additional paramaters, that can be accomplished too:\
```application = !Execute ["chrome.exe" rainmeter.net]```\
```application = !Execute ["chrome.exe" --incognito rainmeter.net]```

You can also launch multiple executables at once by placing multiple actions in consecutive square brackets \
```application= !Execute ["chrome.exe" rainmeter.net]["Calc.exe"]```

## Final notes
